#What is this?
This is a program wrote in C# to automatically correct the ID3 metadata and album cover for your local mp3 files.

#How does it work?

1. Search information in [xiami.com][1] with file's name or rhythm footprint (generated with [Echo Nest][2])
2. Fetch the most appropriate and closest data and download the cover.
3. Write metadata and cover into files with [Do-Anything-With-ID][3].
